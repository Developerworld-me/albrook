<h1> Albrook </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
Albrook is a self hosted audiobook service. Obviously no audiobooks are included, you have to provide your own mp3 files. The point of albrook is simiar to the point of something like booksonic. I found that while booksonic is a great program, it lacked some of the features I wanted, and it was not as stable as I might like.

<h2> Features </h2>

    1.) Audiobook web server
    2.) Web client

This software is in its very early versions and is currently <em> totally </em> unusable as an audiobook serivice yet, eventually it will be, but not yet!
